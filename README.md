# RandomLoader
Loads files to dictionary, then randomly selects one and prints to terminal.

How to use:
Point the load-files script to the top node of your images directory. This will load all files recursively to a dictionary wherever you'd like.

Point the display-image script at your dictionary file, it'll pick one randomly and print it to your terminal.

I'm using icat and kitty for this, but since it's a subprocess you can fill it with whatever you want.
